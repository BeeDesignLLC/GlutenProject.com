# The Gluten Project

<a href="https://zenhub.com"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZenHubIO/support/master/zenhub-badge.png"></a> [![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/BeeDesignLLC/GlutenProject.com.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/) 


**The first website in the world for browsing all 35,000+ certified gluten free products!**

Launched: January, 2018

Over the next few months, we'll be adding affiliate links to all products for purchasing from Amazon, Walmart, and other online merchants.

Additionally, we'll add filtering and sorting options for other food allergies since many people with gluten disorders are allergic to other ingredients.

We're super enthused about the future of The Gluten Project and would love to have your help in spreading the word to people you know!
